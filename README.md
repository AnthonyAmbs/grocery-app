## **About**

This is a full-stack app built with the MEAN stack that lets users create and manage grocery lists. It handles both account creation and login. Users can create, rename, and delete grocery lists. The lists allow users to add items with their names, quantities, and categories. Each item may be edited or deleted, and each item includes a button that strikes the text through to indicate it's been found. The app also includes account settings that let users change their name, email, and password after verifying their account credentials by inputting their username and password.

The frontend is deployed to Netlify, the backend to Render, and the database to MongoDB Atlas.
